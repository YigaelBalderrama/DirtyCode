#DirtyCode this code must be refactored _Yigael Balderrama_

#### This dirty code is being refactored by Diego Sanchez
Check the "refactoring.md" file to see the refactoring process.
(Each push was made after finding and refactoring a code smell)

## Running guide

This program was designed to run each option in a correct order.
This order is:  1, 2 and 3.
Thats because the first option saves the text the user enters. Then with the second option we save that text into a txt file which is named by the user. Finally with the third option the file created is opened in txt editor.

## Aclaration

Maybe it was unnecesary to use IF statements because either way, the user has to select the options in that specific order in order for the program to work correctly.

I didn't change that aspect of the program because my work here was to refactor this code without changing its functionality.
